Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// Added missing closing brackets at the end of the file
};

export default BulkAnalysisPage;
```

The file was missing a closing curly brace `}` for the component definition. I've added it along with the export statement to properly close out the component.

The rest of the file was properly structured and didn't require any additional closing brackets. All other brackets (curly braces, parentheses, and square brackets) were properly matched throughout the code.
